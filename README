An Ada frontend to Bright Cluster Manager

By Ansgar Esztermann <aeszter@mpibpc.mpg.de>

1. Goal
This library began its life as part of Lightsout (by the same author).
When Qview started acquiring active features (versions 2.x an earlier
were passive monitors only), an interface to the cluster manager
seemed promising. Thus, the necessary routines have been extracted
from Lightsout.

2. Requirements
The following libraries are needed:

  * Florist (POSIX API)

Of course, a working Bright Cluster Manager installation is also necessary.

3. Shortcomings/Bugs
For an up-to-date list of bugs, see the issue tracker on GitHub.
